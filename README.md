## Technical Expertise
 python
# Example of medical image processing pipeline
def analyze_medical_image(image):
    # Adaptive thresholding for segmentation
    adaptive = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
    
    # CLAHE for enhancement
    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
    enhanced = clahe.apply(image)
    
    # Watershed for cell separation
    markers = watershed_segmentation(adaptive)
    
    return extract_features(markers)
